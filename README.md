# Rick and Morty Game

This is my first project I started when I began learning HTML and JavaScript. Around this same time I began watching the Rick and Morty show on Cartoon Network, and so I used the theme to help me build this game. 

### Game Objective
- Find Morty
- Find all portal gun parts
- Stay alive


### How to play
Use your keyboard to move Rick around the map to collect objects or interact with characters.
Rick needs to keep his intoxication level up, or he will lose life.
Press T to teleport (only available if all portal gun parts are found)
Press W when in range of Morty to win game (assuming you have all portal gun parts)


### Hint
You can only catch morty by teleporting near him
